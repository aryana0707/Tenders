	            This is a plan to make tender publishing online. 
	            As a part of it, tender data is recorded along with 
	            particulars of the products, their specifications and 
	            conditions. Tenders published will be visible to the 
	            visitors of the site till the closing date of tender.

               Many huge enterprises handle large/huge projects of 
               government and other private enterprises. In all such 
               projects thousands of employees would be working on them.
               Such enterprise requires purchases from various vendors 
               for different purposes. The employees would float 
               tenders globally by advertising in reputed news papers. 
               Advertising in news papers involves lot of cost, 
               searching in news papers is time-consuming, 
               communication gap between buyers and suppliers 
               (only way is through phone or mail), receiving bids and 
               finalizing tenders takes a lot of time. So we make this 
               whole process of tendering online which is efficient 
               and consumes very less  time .
